# Guide: Fix Git Authentication for Kena-AT

The goal is to resolve the `403 Forbidden` error when pushing to `AAU-Connect`. This guide will walk you through updating your Git configuration to use the correct GitHub account.

## Steps to Take

### 1. Update Remote URL
First, we need to make sure Git knows to use the `Kena-AT` username for this repository. Run this command in your terminal:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://Kena-AT@github.com/Kena-AT/AAU-Connect.git
```

### 2. Configure Local Identity
Set your local Git name and email to match your `Kena-AT` account. This ensures your commits are attributed correctly.

```powershell
git config user.name "Kena-AT"
# Replace the email below with the email associated with your Kena-AT account
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### 3. Clear Cached Credentials (If needed)
If you are still prompted with the wrong account or see the 403 error, you might need to remove the old credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.

1. Open **Credential Manager** from the Windows Search bar.
2. Go to **Windows Credentials**.
3. Look for `git:https://github.com` and **Remove** it.
4. The next time you push, Windows will prompt you to log in. Make sure to log in as **Kena-AT**.

## Verification
Run a push to confirm it works:
```powershell
git push origin main
```
